# LPMM - LaunchPad MiddleMan
A middleman script to unlock the full potential of the Novation Launchpad in any MIDI-enabled program.

## What does it do?
The goal of this project is to implement a standalone version of the Ableton Live [Launchpad95 control surface remote script's](http://motscousus.com/stuff/2011-07_Novation_Launchpad_Ableton_Live_Scripts/) best features. It connects to a Novation Launchpad and outputs MIDI notes/controls.

## Why would you do that?
Because Ableton is an expensive software, and I want to use the fantastically inspiring Launchpad95 script in any MIDI-enabled program. This opens the door for using a Launchpad as a serious production and performance tool in open source software, which is part of a larger effort I am making to find/make alternatives for my Windows-only programs that I simply can't live without.

## Does it work yet?
Sort of! It does work as a middleman, but with almost none of the features I want. See below for a todo list. I have a life (a crazy one at that), so no promises on a delivery date. Feel free to offer your help!
